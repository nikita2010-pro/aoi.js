### Using Variables

What are variables? They can be used for many things, especially allowing to save data.

Such as allowing level system, currency system and much more!

```js

bot.variables({

  Name: "Value",

  Name2: "Value2"

})

```

### Callbacks

What are callbacks?

It's simple and easy process, it essentially allows you to run events, such as user joining a Guild.

This will trigger a event, causing a code to be executed such as.

```js

bot.joinCommand({

        channel: "Channel ID", 

        code: `<@$authorID> just joined, welcome!`

})

bot.onJoined()

```

### Setting Bot Status

Add a custom message to your Bot Activity!

```js

bot.status({

  text: "TEXT",

  type: "PLAYING",

  time: 12

})

```
